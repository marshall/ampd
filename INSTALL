NOTE : From v2.0 on, ampd uses gui, this install needs to be done, but the
configuration file is used for the command-line ampd only (for now)


Woohoo! An INSTALL file for ampd :)

Starting with version 1.7.0, ampd has a small script (install_ampd) that will
install the ampd configuration file, and ampd itself for you.

Start off by grabbing the latest tarball at http://ampd.virtualave.net

Then, do these commands:(replace XX.XX.XX with the current version)

	tar -xvzf ampd-XX.XX.XX.tar.gz

	cd ampd-XX.XX.XX
	
From here, you should run the script, here are the few configurable options:

--install-dir[=installdir]		the directory to install ampd and its scripts
								(defaults to ~/ampd)
--mpg123[=/path/to/mpg123]		what you type in to execute mpg123
								(default:mpg123)
--catalog[=/path/to/catalog]	where you want the ampd internal catalog stored
								(default: ~/.ampd_catalog)
--use-color[=yes/no]			whether or not to use color (default:yes)	

Also, make sure if you want ampd to be in PATH that you link it, not copy it.
ampd relies on images in the /path/to/ampd/images directory.
